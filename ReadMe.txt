There are two links for this project
one of them is the frontend part, the second is the backend

I'm still working on the checkout button inside the cart, so because this I am sending the project now
after that I can't send this

You will see the upgrade of the checkout button in github later

also, I used MongoDB as the Data Base to store all the users

Thank you for reading and reviewing my Project and I do hope very much that you like it :)
